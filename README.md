# Implementation

DatabaseSite project has implementation of deliverables. Users are required to login to make changes to the database, but anyone can view the information. Valid login information is a username of `Admin` and a password of `password`. Ajax create and append to table was implemented for departments. There are also unit tests for the controllers(although coverage is not amazing).
